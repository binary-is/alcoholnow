# Er ríkið opið? (AlcoholNow)

„Er ríkið opið?“ is a panic button for Android (and possibly iOS *developers*) who must immediately know the opening hours of alcohol stores in Iceland and their line-of-sight distance.

## Features
- An immediate list of open alcohol stores in Iceland.
- Alcohol dealers are ordered by distance (when location services are available and enabled).

## Disclaimers
1. This project was only developed as an exercise in Android app development using Flutter. There is no serious effort behind it and no commitment to maintain it or even fix bugs, except to keep the app working on the mobile phone of the author and perhaps the author's wife.

2. It is currently **not** distributed in Google's *Play Store* or Apple's *App Store* because frankly, it's beyond the purpose of the project. A downloadable Android package is provided, and it seems to work just fine on an iOS emulator, but that's the extent of iOS support. This may change in the future but is not on any roadmap. If you're interested in distributing it in either store, feel free to contact the author.
